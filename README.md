With this project, I analyze the performance of different parallelization methods in direct convolution reverb algorithms. I implemented the algorithms with OpenMP in C++. See "EE451_report.pdf" for complete analysis.

This project uses code from the “AudioFile” C++ library written by Adam Stark, which is used for reading and writing audio files. This is contained within the "src/" directory, as well as the "AudioFile.h" file and the "AudioFile_README.md" file. All other code is my own.
