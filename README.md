I analyze the performance of different parallelization methods in direct convolution reverb algorithms. Solutions implemented with OpenMP / C++. See "EE451_report.pdf" for complete background, description, and analysis.

This project uses code from the “AudioFile” C++ library written by Adam Stark for reading and writing audio files. This is contained within the "src/" directory, as well as the "AudioFile.h" file and the "AudioFile_README.md" file. All other code is my own.
